# Mushroom Clustering Classification


**KNeighborsClassifier,Random Forest Classifier,Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier were best models of our midterm project.We splitted models.We took feature engineering part from our midterm project.We split data for training.After that groups member interested in own models.When we tried to combine our models in a single ipynb file,there began to be fluctuations in values.Therefore we reduced the number of kmeans clusters to 30 to check the accuracies with different parameters.**
